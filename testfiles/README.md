#Introduction
#####Mood Ring is a full stack application that utilizes Ruby on Rails, Javascript, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord and Angular. Rails is used as an API and Angular is utilized as a front end application.

#####Mood Ring as an app is interesting. It takes difficult to define qualitative information--human emotion--and quantifies it as data, showing the user the intensity of their emotions and how often they feel them. These emotions are then mapped and visualized for the user.

#Preparation
#####Our initial planning involved deciding on basic goals and higher-end achievements. At its base, we want this to be a fully functioning CRUD app that is clean, accessible and beautiful. Our higher end goal involves facial recognition software to determine from user-generated images their emotions and confidence levels.
